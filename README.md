# BSV-Stuff
This is a repository I shall use to toy around with Bluespec-SystemVerilog.

It may contain solutions to exercises you are doing. Don't look at the code if you don't want to get spoiled.

This also contains the compiled verilog code, so everyone can run this code on their Basys3 boards or adapt it run on $FPGA.
